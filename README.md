# -Deep-Policy-Iteration

Deep Policy Iteration (DPI) is an algorithm for solving high-dimensional stochastic Mean-Field Games.

# Paper
The accompanying paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10827

# Usage
In order to start training, do

```bash
python main_DPI.py
```

In the `main_DPI.py`, you can adjust hyperparameters for training and modify the environment by defining the Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, conditions, and other parameters to suit the specific problem you want to solve. The current focus is on Analytic Comparison.
